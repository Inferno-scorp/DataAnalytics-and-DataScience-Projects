**Overview of [project](https://github.com/Inferno-scorp/DataAnalytics-and-DataScience-Projects/blob/main/SupervisedML/PredictionOfScoresBasedOnStudyHours.ipynb)**


This is an overview of our project which I've done as a part of TheSparksFoundation Internship Programme.                                                           
Here My task was to **predict the percentage of student based on his/her number of study hours from given dataset.**
- In which I've had to find out whether there is any relationship or correlation between both variable or not, later predicting the student's percentage based on his/her study hours.
(Which can be useful for students who are not sure whether longer study hours are responsible for students performance or not and it can also used as an important advice to students by teachers or parents.)
