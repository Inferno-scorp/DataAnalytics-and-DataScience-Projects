<p><strong>Overview of <a href="https://github.com/Inferno-scorp/DataAnalytics-and-DataScience-Projects/blob/main/GlobalTerrorismDataset/Global_Terrorism.ipynb">project</a></strong></p>
<p>This is an overview of our project which I&#39;ve done as a part of TheSparksFoundation Internship Programme.<br>Here My task was to <strong>perform the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) task on &quot;The Global Terrorism Dataset&quot;.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In which I&#39;ve had to think myself of being a Security/Defence Analyst whose task is to get some key Issues and Insights through Analysis.
(Which will be helpful for the person/people to get to know what are the Red-Zones and Safe-Zones of terrorism, with that gaining some key constraints and insights about their Safety.)</li>
